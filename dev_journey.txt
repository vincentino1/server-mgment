My Journey into DevOps

Deciding to transition into tech was a personal choice. Deep down, I knew I had what it takes to develop myself and become a tech expert. However, the real challenge was figuring out which area of tech I wanted to focus on.

After doing some research and exploring different paths, I decided to go into DevOps. But figuring out how to start became a daily struggle. I realized that just picking up random materials or watching YouTube videos wouldn’t be enough to compete with others who already have strong skills in the field.

That realization led me to enroll in a training program with Claret Young. Honestly, the journey so far has been smooth and encouraging. While learning new tools and concepts can sometimes be challenging, Claret's teaching style makes it easier to understand and stay motivated.

To further strengthen my skills, I also spend time reading additional materials and watching YouTube tutorials related to topics we cover in class. I’m fully committed to this path.

If I stay consistent and keep following this trajectory, I strongly believe that in the next six months, I’ll be ready to enter the job market and confidently aim for a six-figure DevOps role.
